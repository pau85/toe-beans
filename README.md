# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Sorry its been a while since the last update. I had a wedding party to plan (I got married!) and then I ran into some errors when trying to test and then I realized I needed to add more configurations and dependencies for my project. I also added a clock! It so far only starts at 12:00 each time it is rendered.

So the next update will be adding the real-time to it so it will display the current time of day based on timezone selection.

Alright!! I have some cool updates to share. 
1. The clock is officially working with the current time.
2. The window size is set to 600x800 upon clicking on Butters on my website pau85.github.io. This was done so that the user can have a good experience visually upon first opening the application. I wanted to make sure that the clock and sleeping butters are set where they should be.
3. I also added some other things like an ico file, some titles (for accessibility - trying to be as mindful as possible in this area) and I also expanded the image of the living room a bit vertically. I plan to have one other object in the image, which may or may not be a new component... until next time!
